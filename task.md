# Secret Server Coding Task

# Introduction
Your task is to implement a secret server. The secret server can be used to store and share secrets using the random generated URL. But the secret can be read only a limited number of times after that it will expire and won’t be available. The secret may have TTL. After the expiration time the secret won’t be available anymore. You can find the detailed API documentation in the swagger.yaml file. We recommend to use Swagger or any other OpenAPI implementation to read the documentation.

# Task
Implementation: You have to implement the whole Secret Server API. If it is not specified you can choose the technology you want to use (database, programming language, etc). However it would be wise to store the data using encryption now this is not part of the task. You can use plain text to store your secrets. The response can be XML or JSON too. Use a configuration file to switch between the two response type.

Hosting: You also have to deploy and host the service. There are hundreds of free solutions to do this. So this shouldn't be an issue. If this API was used in production, then HTTPS would be a must but this is not the case now, use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Share the code: Upload the code to your GitHub account and share with us.
